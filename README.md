## Description

For this Coding Bootcamp challenge, we had to edit existing HTML and CSS code in order to make it more accessible. This included adding semantic HTML tags, alt text for images, and consolidating the CSS selectors. Semantic HTML tags add meaning to the HTML tags, so that developers or people using screen readers can understand the structure of the webpage. Consolidated CSS improves readability for developers and functionality for users.

I learned a few new HTML tags, such as ```<nav>``` and ```<aside>```. I also learned how much you can clean up a CSS file by using HTML tags as selectors, rather than using many individual classes and IDs.

## Usage

Use the Chrome developer tool to see the HTML and CSS, including my comments.

## Credits

The source code came from the EdX / University of Minnesota coding bootcamp course. I edited the code for the assignment.
